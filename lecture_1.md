Introduction to NLP and Deep Learning

--- 

## What is Natural Language Processing?

- is a field at the intersection of 
	- computer science
	- artificial intelligence
	- and linguistics

- Goal: for computers to process or `understand` natural language in order to perform tasks that are useful, e.g.,

	- Proforming tasks, like making appointments, buying things
	- Question answering
		- Siri, google Assistant....

- Fully `understanding and representing the meaning` of language(or even defining) is a difficult goal.

	- Perfect language understanding is AI-complete


> 什麼是 NLP, 
> 
> 包含了cs, AI, 以及語言學 的一個 領域
> 
> 目標 : 以計算機理解或者處理 自然語言 以執行有用任務
> 
> 完美的語言理解是由 AI 完成

## NLP Levels
level of language

- `speech - > Phonetic/Phonological Analysis`
- text -> OCR/Tokenization
- Morphological anakysis
- `Syntactic Analysis`
- `Semantic Interpretation`
- Discourse Processing

> 這堂課 專注在  `Syntactic Analysis` 以及 `Semantic Interpretation`, 以及一點 `speech - > Phonetic/Phonological Analysis`

## What's special about human language?

**A human language is a system specifically constructed to convey the speaker/writer’s meaning**

human language is a symbolic/categorical/signaling system.

## What's Deep learning?

### machine first
- Deeping learning is a subfield of machine learning.
- Most machine learning methods work well because of human-designed representations and input features
- Machine learning becomes just optimizing weights to best make a final prediction

> 機器學習 運作良好是因為 人為設計的表徵和輸入特徵
> 機器學習只是優化了權重才能做出最終的預測


### Deep Learning

- Representation learning
	- attempts to automatically learn good features or representations

- Deep learning 
	- algorithms attempt to learn (multiple levels of) representation and an output

- From 'raw' inputs x
	(e.g., sound, characters, or words)
	

### Deep learning for Speech

Context-Dependent Pre-trained Deep Neural Networks for Large Vocabulary Speech Recognition Dahl et al. (2010)

## Why is NLP hard?

- Complexity in representing, learning and using linguistic/situational/world/visual knowledge
- Human languages are ambiguous
- Human language interpretation depends on real world, common sense, and contextual knowledge

> 人類語言的解釋取決於現實世界
